# AttentionGrid: Unleashing Attention Power in AI Models 🚀
AttentionGrid is a cutting-edge framework designed to democratize the incorporation of advanced attention mechanisms into AI models. Powered by the latest developments in attention-based transformer models, AttentionGrid opens up the world of attention mechanisms to machine learning practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts alike.  


## Getting Started: Installation 🚀

To blast off with AttentionGrid, install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install AttentionGrid
```

Implementing an attention mechanism or a transformer model with AttentionGrid is as easy as:

```python
from AttentionGrid.transformers import BERT
from AttentionGrid.attentions import MultiHeadAttention

# Initialize your classes and use them as required
```

Thank you for supporting AttentionGrid and contributing to the democratization of AI! Together, we can push the boundaries of what's possible.

## Vision 👁️

In the vast landscape of AI, attention mechanisms have revolutionized our ability to create powerful models that can discern the subtleties in data, focusing on important aspects and improving overall performance. Our vision with AttentionGrid is to bridge the gap between these state-of-the-art mechanisms and their practical applications, providing a tool that makes these techniques accessible and easy to implement in diverse AI applications.

## Architecture 🏗️

AttentionGrid is designed with an intuitive and flexible architecture, partitioned into four primary components:

1. **Core** 💡: This is the bedrock of our framework, housing abstract classes that layout the basic structure for attention mechanisms and transformer models.

2. **Attentions** 🧠: The directory dedicated to various attention mechanisms. Each attention mechanism is implemented based on the blueprint provided in the Core.

3. **Transformers** 🤖: This is where transformer models come to life, each sculpted following the design defined in the Core.

4. **Utils** 🛠️: A toolbox filled with helper classes for essential tasks like model loading, data preprocessing, and more.

5. **Examples** 🎯: Demystifying the implementation with hands-on examples and usage scenarios.



## Key Features ✨

- **Modular Structure**: Mix and match different attention mechanisms with a variety of transformer models.

- **User Friendly**: Clear documentation and examples to help you get started quickly.

- **Open Source**: Open to contributions, AttentionGrid thrives on collective knowledge and shared progress.


For more detailed examples, please refer to the 'examples' folder in our repository.

## Contribution 🤝

We openly invite contributions to AttentionGrid! Whether you have a new feature suggestion, bug report, or want to add to our code, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## License 📜

AttentionGrid is proudly open-source software, licensed under the APACHE License.

## Why AttentionGrid? 🎯

Attention mechanisms have transformed AI, enabling machines to 'focus' on significant parts of input data. With AttentionGrid, we aim to democratize access to these powerful tools. We believe that the future of AI lies in the power of attention, and through AttentionGrid, we hope to accelerate this journey. Explore our repository, join our cause, and let's navigate this exciting landscape together!
