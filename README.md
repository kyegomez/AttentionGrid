# AttentionGrid üöÄ

AttentionGrid is an innovative framework designed to streamline the process of developing and implementing attention-based transformer models. Unleash the potential of attention mechanisms for diverse AI applications with AttentionGrid.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Our framework is divided into four primary components:
1. Core: The abstract classes that define the fundamental structure of attention mechanisms and transformer models.
2. Attentions: The different attention mechanisms implemented as per the design laid out in the core.
3. Transformers: Transformer models implemented as per the design laid out in the core.
4. Utils: Helper classes for tasks like loading models and processing data.

## Getting Started üöÄ

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install AttentionGrid
```

**Foundational Abstract Classes:**

```python
class AbstractAttention(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def forward(self, *args, **kwargs):
        pass

class AbstractTransformer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def forward(self, *args, **kwargs):
        pass
```


## Usage üí°

Import the required modules and use them in your project. For instance, to use BERT with multi-head attention:

```python
from AttentionGrid.transformers import BERT
from AttentionGrid.attentions import MultiHeadAttention

# Instantiate your classes and use them as per requirement.
```

For detailed examples, refer to the examples folder in the repository.

## Attention and Transformers in AI ü§ñ

Attention mechanisms have transformed the landscape of AI, enabling machines to focus on the important parts of the input data. This is particularly useful in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and many more. With AttentionGrid, we aim to democratize access to these powerful technologies.
